                <br>
                <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence (EQ)?</h3>
                <p>One way of looking at EQ is a skill to manage your own and others emotions. Some people argue that it's about being able to recognize, analyze, and understand your own emotions and how they might affect others. More advanced is the ability to control your emotions in the right way. Being able to feel what others are feeling is also a trait of EQ. 
                    More advanced is the ability to act accordingly to others feelings.</p>
                <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
                <p>IQ refers to a different set of skills. IQ includes skills
                     like verbal reasoning, quantitative aptitude etc.</p>
                <h3>Why is it important?</h3>   
                <p>EQ is important because it forms the basis of what makes us human. The ability to not only sense 
                    and regulate our own emotions but to be empathetic towards others. </p>
