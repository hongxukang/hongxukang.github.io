                <h1>Neuroplasticity + Growth Mindset</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Neuroplasticity is the ability for the brain to reorganize itself by forming and recognizing new synaptic connections. This occurs frequently when we have new experiences or learn new things. It benefits us by empowering us to believe that we can learn anything. I benefit from the idea of neuroplasticity simply by feeling more confident in my ability to learn something I didn’t know before, as opposed to believing that I was born with a fixed IQ and therefore there is a limit to how much I can learn. <br><br> The growth mindset is related to this where people believe that they can improve their abilities by working harder. The alternative is a mindset where one believes their abilities are fixed and they were born that way. The advantage of the growth mindset is to motivate people from working harder and to try doing things. </p>
