                <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h1>   
                <br>
                <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. </h3>
                <p>My culture has led me to identify as a Chinese person. What that means to me includes celebrating certain festivals, like the Lunar New Year, and the Lantern Festival. In terms of values, my cultural background has made me value a strong work ethic, as we were taught from a young age from folktales to poetries that being hardworking is a virtue.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
                <p>I believe my strengths include conscientiousness, communication skills, and analytical skills. Things I would like to improve on are my time management, stress management, and project  management skills.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
                <p>I hope I can make improvements in time, stress, and project management by frequently communicating with others for feedback and to be analytical about the way I am managing those items. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took. </h3>
                <p>One example when I had to make an ethical decision was in secondary school, 
                    I saw a classmate steal a friend’s wallet during P.E. in the changing room. 
                    On the one hand, I know that that particular classmate had financial difficulties,
                     and if caught stealing, he would be in a lot of trouble, perhaps even getting 
                     kicked out of school. On the other hand, there is an ethical obligation to address 
                     the theft, because it is wrong to steal. In the end, I told that classmate that I 
                     saw what happened, and told him if he returned the wallet to my friend and never to 
                     do it again, I wouldn’t tell the teachers. My classmate proceeded to return the wallet 
                     anonymously. I did not hear of or see him stealing after that.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
                <p>During my undergraduate studies, I was in a student club that hosted cultural exchange events. One time, two of our teammates in the group of organizers had a very bad argument midway through the planning stage. This argument relates to something personal. One of them decided to be completely unengaged and not show up to the meetings. It was a difficult situation because we were all students, and there were no authoritative figures like a teacher to go to. We first tried to encourage the two of them to reconcile their differences. That did not succeed. We then spoke with the unengaged teammate about the importance of this event. We tried to reemphasize the purpose of allowing students from different backgrounds to meet one another and to educate others about their culture. The unengaged teammate ended up returning to the meetings and was very helpful in organizing the event. This experience taught me how important communication is in working well as a team. </p>
