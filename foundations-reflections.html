                <h3>What surprised me the most about learning core is… </h3>
                <p>The time management techniques taught were quite new to me. I was surprised by how effective those techniques were. It helped me become more productive and better at managing stress levels. I tried to stick with the recommended times for each assignment and I found it useful because it stopped me from spending too much time studying things that may not be immediately applicable, in turn, allowing me to focus on the big picture. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
                <p>The three things are - patience, communication, time-management</p>
                <br>
                <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                <p>They help a person learn better by regulating their emotions, especially when things get difficult. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                <p>I find CSS the most tricky.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
                <p>Core learning is important because programmers work intimately with people and are ultimately building things for people. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                <p>I find it enjoyable and important. The reason is because I think it is important in making me a more well rounded and introspective person.</p>
