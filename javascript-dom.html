                <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
                <p>MHTML and CSS are used to build websites. Using a table as an analogy, HTML would represent the structural components like the legs and the top and CSS 
                    would represent the stylistic components, like the paint or the table cloth. </p>
                <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h3>
                <p>Control flow is the order in which code is executed. In Javascript it flows from top to bottom unless there is a loop in the code (a few other exceptions as well). The flow can be thought of as a person waking up in the middle of the night needing to go to the toilet. Normally the person would walk straight from the bedroom to the toilet. This is like the regular top to bottom flow of Javascript. However, one night, the person notices a leakage in the kitchen. The person then immediately goes to the leakage and stays until it's fixed. This represents how the flow stops going from top to bottom when it encounters a loop. The person then continues towards the toilet after the leakage is fixed, 
                    representing how the flow continues from top to bottom after exiting the loop. </p>
                <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>   
                <p>DOM or the Document Object Model in essence is how the website is structured. It’s like an essay where there is an introduction, several body paragraphs, and a conclusion.  The webpage categorizing different parts in different ways allow developers to refer to individual sections and edit it. Using the analogy of the essay, the developer can target 
                    the introduction and make the text red while the rest stays the same color. </p>
                <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
                <p>Arrays and objects are ways in which data is stored. An example 
                    of an array is [apple,orange,lemon]. An example of an object is {apple: 1, orange: 4, lemon: 2}.
                    Conceptually they are both just ways to group data. The array 
                    is like a box where the items inside are not only stored but are 
                    placed in specific locations so they are ordered. The apple goes 
                    first, orange second, and lemon third. Developers can retrieve 
                    the apple by referring to the position in which it is stored. 
                    They can go like - I want the fruit from the first position - then an apple would appear. Objects are a bit 
                    more like an excel table where you can write down how many of each item you have. 
                    So on one column you can write down the names of the fruits and then next to it, 
                    you can write its quantity. Not only quantities, but other attributes like color,
                     price, weight etc. can be noted down instead. So an object can also look like 
                     {apple: red, orange: orange, lemon: yellow} 
                     </p>
                <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
                <p>Functions can be thought of as a machine where you put something in it, the machine does a number of adjustments to the item and creates a new item for you. It is useful because those you can just duplicate this machine and use it in different locations
                     without having to organize and attempt to duplicate the individual adjustments.</p>
