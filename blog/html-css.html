<h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding? </h1>

<h2><u>Basics</u></h2>
<p><em> Think of elements as rectangles of pixels</em></p>
<h3>Margin</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Margin dictates space outside the element</li>
    <li>Useful for changing an element's position on the page</li>
    <li>Useful for setting distance between elements</li>
</ol>
<h3>Padding</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Padding dictates space inside the element</li>
    <li>Useful for adding space between content and borders</li>
    <li>Userful for changing the size of an element e.g. create a larger button</li>
</ol>
<h3>Border</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Boundary between what's defined as inside an element and outside an element</li>
    <li>Be default set to 0</li>
    <li>Useful for stylistic purposes</li>
</ol>

<h2><u>Analogy</u></h2>
<p> There is a room. In the room there is a hamster in a box. There is also an axolotl in an aquarium in the same room. 
    The space between the box/aquarium and the wall of the room is the margin. The space between the box and the aquarium is also the margin.
    To move the box and the aquarium closer together is like changing the margin between two elements. The space between the hamster and the box, or the axolotl and the aquarium 
    is the padding. To increase the size of the box to give the hamster more room, can be likened to increasing the padding of an element. 
    The border is the walls of the box or the walls of the aquarium. Making the glass walls on the aquarium thicker is like increasing the thickness of the border.</p>
