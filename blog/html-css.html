                <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding? </h1>
                <p> We can think of elements (e.g. buttons) as rectangles of pixels.</p>
                <h3>MARGIN</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Margin dictates space outside the element (or the rectangle of pixels)</li>
                    <li>It is useful for changing an element's position on the page</li>
                    <li>It is useful for setting the distance between elements</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>PADDING</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Padding dictates space inside the element</li>
                    <li>It is useful for adding space between content and borders</li>
                    <li>It is useful for changing the size of an element (e.g. create a larger button)</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>BORDER</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The border is the boundary between what's defined as inside an element and outside an element</li>
                    <li>By default it is set to 0, meaning even if it is not visible, it is present</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p> An analogy may help the understanding. In a room there is a toy in a box and next to that box is a fruit in a jar. 
                    The space between the box and the wall of the room is the margin. So if we were to increase the size of the room, say by knocking the walls down and building it a few meters away, that is 
                    analogous to increasing the margin. Recall margin dictates the space outside the element. Another description of a margin is the space between the box and the jar.
                    If we were to move the box and the jar closer together, it is analogous to changing the margin between two elements. The space between the toy and the box represents the padding. Increasing 
                    the size of the box, is analogous to increasing the padding of an element. Recall padding dictates the space inside the element.
                    The walls of the box represent the border. Making the walls thicker is analogous to increasing the thickness of the border.</p>
