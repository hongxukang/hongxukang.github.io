                <h1>LEARNING PLAN</h1>
                <br>
                <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
                <p>My long term goal is to start a business that focuses on building digital 
                    products that address social issues I care about.</p>
                <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
                <p>I believe my strengths include conscientiousness, communication skills, and 
                    analytical skills. Things I would like to improve on are my time management, 
                    stress management, and project  management skills.</p>
                <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed 
                    in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>   
                <p>I would like to develop my time-management skills.</p>
                <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
                <p>There are a couple of things I will try to do to manage the workload in this 
                    programme. First, I will try to be reflective of my stress levels. For example,
                    when I am very stressed out I tend to eat a lot of junk food. So if I start 
                    doing that it is a reminder that maybe I am quite stressed out. When I am 
                    stressed out, I will attempt to take a short break and meditate. Meditation 
                    is my method of destressing. Second, I will try to keep a record of the time 
                    I take to work on each section and to take sufficient breaks in between. 
                    Third, I will try to ask for help when I am stuck on something for too long. </p>
                <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
                <p>I will seek help in a timely way by evaluating a few things. First, I will 
                    try to judge whether it is a situation where I don’t know what I don’t know,
                    or if it is a case of where I know what I don’t know. Second, I will evaluate
                    how much time and energy I have to do the relevant research. If it is in the not knowing what is unknown category, I will immediately 
                    ask for help. If I am down on time or energy, I will also ask for help. Otherwise, 
                    I will try to figure things out myself.</p>
                <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
                <p>I expect the team to help me in both tech and core by giving me the necessary 
                    amount of guidance. I hope the team can tell me both the positives and the 
                    negatives of what I am doing (or not doing).</p>
