                <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
                <br>
                <p> Problem solving is a key skill for software developers. The first step when approaching a problem is to understand the problem. It is important to learn about what the question is asking and to have a good understanding of what each part of the question means. More specifically, some problems may have code that you don’t understand. In that case, I would spend a bit of time researching what those symbols mean. The second step is to come up with the pseudocode. Pseudocode is a way in which we verbalize the code in an everyday language. It is really just a way to explain what you want to do with the code, without really going into the syntax and making the code work. <br><br> There may be times when you run into problems where you cannot come up with the pseudocode. In this case, the first thing to do is to split the large problem into smaller parts. Often in coding problems, they can be broken down into smaller components. Smaller components are easier to understand and solve. Using Google to search up relevant questions is also an important skill for a developer. If stuck, you must learn to ask questions on google. One useful function is console.log(), as this would allow you to see inside the code at different points of your whole program. As a result, you can place different console.log() throughout the code to see whether the variables or the items returned are the same as intended.  </p>
